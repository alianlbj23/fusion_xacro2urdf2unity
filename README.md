This repository is cited from [xacro2urdf](https://github.com/doctorsrn/xacro2urdf). We write some scripts to help us quickly create URDF files for Unity from [fusion2urdf](https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf).



# Usage

Put the script into the same folder of `urdf` folder. And then run the script.
